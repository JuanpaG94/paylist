# Paylist Mobile Application
Paylist is a mobile application made with React Native & Firebase technologies, compatible with both iOS and Android, that allows you to manage your online subscriptions(like Netflix, Spotify, Amazon, etc.) and also your purchase tickets.

This is my end of degree work in Software Engineering at University of Seville (Spain).
